# JavaProjects
These are the Java projects that I have been working on/completed during my internship at Birlasoft.

### Assignment 1
This assignment involved me creating a project that randomized a value from 0 - 100, and a user had infinite number of guesses to reach the correct randomized value. The project would respond to the user, depending on how many guesses it took, and the user recieves an option to play again. I had to validate if user responses were actually number values.

### Assignment 2
This assignment involved me creating a project that created a formatted printed list of an address book. The user would have an option to print the existing entries, add an entry, or exit the program. If the user wished to add an entry, this new entry would be added to the existing entries. I had to validate which option the user chose.
